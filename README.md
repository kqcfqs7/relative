## FAQ

**How long does psyllium husk fiber take to start working for constipation?**
Psyllium generally begins working within 72 hours of consistent use, though timing varies based on diet, hydration levels, and individual digestive health. Drink at least one full glass of water with each dose to help fiber form gel and move through digestive system properly. Consistency matters more than single doses—take fiber daily rather than sporadically for best results.

**Will daily fiber supplements cause gas or bloating?**
Initial gas and bloating are normal when first adding fiber as digestive system adjusts, but symptoms typically fade as body adapts. Start with smaller servings and gradually increase to full suggested amount while drinking plenty of water with each dose. Methylcellulose-based Citrucel produces significantly less gas than psyllium if bloating remains problematic.

**What's the difference between soluble and insoluble fiber supplements?**
Soluble fiber dissolves in water forming gel-like substance helping regulate cholesterol and blood sugar while softening stools, whereas insoluble fiber adds bulk mechanically helping food move through digestive system. Psyllium contains 70-80% soluble and 20-30% insoluble providing both benefits, while methylcellulose is purely insoluble. Most people benefit from combination of both types either through mixed-source supplements or varied diet.
